let firstName = "Konain"
let lastName = "Raza";

console.log( firstName + " " + lastName); //if we want full name so we use string concatenation but there is one problem that we have to manually amange spaces for typography and we have add + operator this is oldest way so now we use string literals
console.log(`my full name is ${firstName} ${lastName} `)// in this syntax we have used backticks ` and for variable value we use ${varName} we can also perform operation in it
