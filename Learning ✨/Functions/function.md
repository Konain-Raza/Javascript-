# Functions üöÄ

Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to organize your code, make it more modular, and avoid repetition.

## Introduction üìñ

Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript programming. They encapsulate a set of instructions that can be invoked multiple times with different inputs.

## Defining Functions ‚úçÔ∏è

You can define a function using the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and the function body enclosed in curly braces.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### Function Parameters üîß

Functions can accept parameters, which are placeholders for values that are passed into the function when it's called.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
### Return Statement ‚Ü©Ô∏è

The return statement is used to specify the value that the function should return when it's called.

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
### Anonymous Functions üë§

Anonymous functions are functions without a name. They are often used as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.

```javascript
const sayHello = function() {
  console.log('Hello!');
};
```
### Arrow Functions ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They are especially useful for defining functions as inline callbacks.

```javascript
const square = (x) => x * x;
```
### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a function that is executed immediately after it's defined. It's often used to create a private scope for variables.

```javascript
(function() {
  console.log('This function is invoked immediately');
})();
```
### Closures üîí

Closures are functions that retain access to variables from their containing scope even after the parent function has finished executing. They are powerful for maintaining state in JavaScript programs.

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return ++count;
  };
}
```
### Recursion üîÑ

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's commonly used for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```
### Best Practices üåü

- **Naming**: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for functions.
- **Single Responsibility**: Keep functions focused on doing one thing well.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling and validation in functions.
- **Comments**: Document your functions with clear comments to explain their purpose and usage.

### Practice Question üìù

You're tasked with implementing a function that simulates a simple game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer. The function should take the player's choice as input and return the result of the game.

Write JavaScript code to accomplish the following tasks:

- Define a function called `playGame` that takes the player's choice (either "rock", "paper", or "scissors") as a parameter and returns the result of the game.
- The computer's choice should be randomly generated each time the function is called.
- The function should compare the player's choice with the computer's choice and determine the winner based on the standard rules of rock-paper-scissors:
  - Rock beats scissors
  - Scissors beats paper
  - Paper beats rock
- If both the player and computer choose the same option, it's a tie.
- Return a string indicating the result of the game (e.g., "You win!", "You lose!", "It's a tie!").
