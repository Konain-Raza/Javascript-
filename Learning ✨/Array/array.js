// An array is used when we want to store multiple values in a single variable. 
// Unlike a simple variable (e.g., var), which stores a single value in memory, an array stores the addresses of all its elements.
// Arrays provide a simple syntax for storing and accessing multiple values.

let names = ["Konain", "raza", "shehzad"];
console.log(names); // Now we print the 'names' array. Instead of creating three separate variables, we store all names in one variable.
// Arrays also provide methods to perform operations on their elements, which we'll learn about later.
