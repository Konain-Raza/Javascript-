# 💛 JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a versatile, high-level, dynamically-typed programming language that enables interactive web pages and is essential for web development alongside HTML and CSS. Known for its ability to handle both client-side and server-side tasks, JavaScript is single-threaded, asynchronous, and uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for efficient execution. It allows developers to create dynamic features that enhance user experience, manipulate the DOM, interact with databases, and manage data. With the rise of Node.js, JavaScript has extended its reach to server-side applications, making it a critical tool for full-stack development.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

To get started with JavaScript, you need a code editor and a web browser. We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your editor.

#### 🛠️ Installing Visual Studio Code:

1. **Download VS Code:**
   - Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the version for your operating system.
   - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)

2. **Install VS Code:**
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Open VS Code:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code from your applications menu.

### Step 2: Write Your First JavaScript Code

1. **Create a new file:**
   - Open VS Code and create a new file named `index.html`.

2. **Add HTML structure:**
   - Add the following basic HTML structure to your `index.html` file:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>JavaScript Course</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Welcome to JavaScript!</h1>
         <script src="script.js"></script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Create a JavaScript file:**
   - In the same directory, create a new file named `script.js`.

4. **Add JavaScript code:**
   - Open `script.js` and add the following code:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
     ```

5. **Run your code:**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser. Open the browser’s developer console (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) and you should see the message "Hello, JavaScript!" printed in the console.
